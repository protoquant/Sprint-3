I have joined most of the columns to together 
Spreading from ftx, debirit and compound finance data
For now we have one hour data for BTC, ETH, BCH, LTC, SOL.
According to ftx website we can only get the right data for 15s,
30s, 1h, 4h, 8h, and 1D. If you try to get for
Other resolution you would not get the right data and timeframe.

Compound finance. I have gotten data for BTC, ETH, DAI, USDT, USDC. Not done with compound finance because if you are getting values the right way most times you would have to wait
Two plus hours to get an output. 

For deribit I have gotten values for btc, ETH, SOL

Thank you for your patience. 

Although I am not still done. At least 85â„… of the data have been collected. The code are correct.
